    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti alla Carbonara is one of the most famous pasta dishes from Rome, beloved for its creamy texture and rich flavor. Made with just a few ingredients—eggs, cheese (Pecorino Romano), pancetta (or guanciale), and black pepper—it’s a perfect example of Italian culinary simplicity. The key to Carbonara is the technique of tossing the hot pasta with the egg mixture, creating a velvety sauce without the need for cream. Despite its humble ingredients, the dish is incredibly satisfying and is a staple of Roman cuisine.</p>
    
    <p>Whether you’re enjoying it as a quick weekday meal or a weekend indulgence, Spaghetti alla Carbonara is guaranteed to be a hit. It’s a great dish to introduce people to the concept of pasta without heavy sauces, relying instead on the natural richness of eggs and cheese. With its balance of salty, creamy, and peppery flavors, it’s a comfort food that’s hard to beat.</p>

        <h2>Steps to Cook Spaghetti alla Carbonara for 4 People</h2>
    
        <h3 class="step">1. Cook the Pasta</h3>
        <ol class="steps-font">
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti according to package instructions, usually about 8-10 minutes, until al dente.</li>
            <li>Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water before draining the spaghetti.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h3 class="step">2. Prepare the Carbonara Sauce</h3>
        <ol class="steps-font">
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them together with the Pecorino Romano and Parmesan cheese until smooth. Add a good amount of freshly ground black pepper to taste. Set aside.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h3 class="step">3. Cook the Guanciale</h3>
        <ol class="steps-font">
            <li>Heat a large pan over medium heat. Add the diced guanciale (or pancetta) and cook until it becomes crispy and golden brown, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>If the guanciale is lean, add a little olive oil to the pan to help crisp it up.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h3 class="step">4. Combine Pasta and Guanciale</h3>
        <ol class="steps-font">
            <li>Add the cooked spaghetti to the pan with the guanciale, and toss it around to coat the pasta in the rendered fat.</li>
            <li>If necessary, add a bit of reserved pasta water to help coat the pasta evenly and prevent it from becoming too dry.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h3 class="step">5. Add the Carbonara Sauce</h3>
        <ol class="steps-font">
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat and quickly pour in the egg and cheese mixture, tossing the pasta rapidly to create a smooth, creamy sauce. The residual heat from the pasta and guanciale will cook the eggs, forming a silky sauce.</li>
            <li>If the sauce is too thick, add a bit more reserved pasta water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h3 class="step">6. Serve</h3>
        <ol class="steps-font">
            <li>Serve the spaghetti immediately, garnished with extra Pecorino Romano and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <p>Enjoy your authentic and creamy Spaghetti alla Carbonara!</p>
