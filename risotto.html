    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Risotto alla Milanese is a classic Italian dish known for its creamy texture and vibrant golden hue. The key to its richness lies in the use of saffron, which is infused into the broth, giving the dish its signature flavor and color. Traditionally served in Milan, this risotto is made with Arborio rice, known for its ability to absorb liquids and create a creamy, velvety texture. The addition of butter, Parmesan cheese, and sometimes a touch of bone marrow or stock brings a richness that complements the delicate saffron. It’s a comforting yet refined dish, perfect for a special dinner or as a luxurious side to a main course.</p>
    
    <p>Though it originates from Milan, Risotto alla Milanese has gained popularity across Italy and around the world. The balance of flavors makes it an ideal accompaniment to roasted meats or as a stand-alone dish. For those new to Italian cooking, it’s a great introduction to risotto, with its slightly sweet, floral saffron flavor providing a unique twist on the traditional risotto experience.</p>

        <h3 class="step">1. Prepare the Broth</h3>

            <li>In a small saucepan, heat the chicken or vegetable broth over low heat.</li>
            <li>Add the saffron threads to the broth and let them steep as the broth warms up. This infuses the liquid with color and flavor.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h3 class="step">2. Sauté the Onion</h3>
        <ol class="steps-font">
            <li>In a large skillet or wide saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped onion and sauté for 3-4 minutes, until softened but not browned.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h3 class="step">3. Toast the Rice</h3>
        <ol class="steps-font">
            <li>Add the Arborio rice to the pan with the onions and stir to coat the grains in butter.</li>
            <li>Toast the rice for 1-2 minutes until it becomes translucent around the edges.</li>

        </ol>
    
        <h3 class="step">6. Finish the Risotto</h3>
        <ol class="steps-font">
