    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that layers rich flavors and comforting textures into a hearty meal. 
        At its core, lasagna features sheets of tender pasta layered with a savory mixture of ground meat, onions, garlic, 
        and tomato sauce, creating a robust base. Between these layers, creamy ricotta cheese or béchamel sauce is spread 
        generously, complemented by a blend of grated mozzarella and Parmesan that melts into a bubbly, golden topping when baked. 
        Herbs like oregano, basil, and parsley infuse the dish with aromatic notes, making each bite a symphony of flavors. Lasagna is 
        traditionally baked in a casserole dish, allowing the layers to meld together into a cohesive, satisfying entrée.
    </p>
    <p>While the traditional recipe is beloved worldwide, lasagna has evolved into countless variations, 
        reflecting regional and dietary preferences. Vegetable lasagna, for instance, swaps meat for a medley of zucchini, 
        spinach, and mushrooms, appealing to vegetarians. Meanwhile, gluten-free or keto-friendly versions use alternatives 
        like zucchini slices or eggplant in place of pasta. Regardless of the variation, lasagna remains a quintessential 
        comfort food that is perfect for feeding a crowd, freezing for later, or simply enjoying as a family favorite. Its warm, 
        cheesy, and flavorful profile makes it an enduring dish for celebrations and casual dinners alike.

    <h2>Steps to Cook Lasagna for 6 People</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Meat Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat</li>
            <li>Add the chopped onion and sauté for 3-4 minutes until softened.</li>
            <li>Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef (or pork) and cook until browned, breaking it up into small pieces with a spoon. Drain excess fat if needed.</li>
            <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, salt, pepper, and sugar (if using). Add water if the sauce is too thick.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat and let the sauce simmer for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow flavors to meld.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>2. Prepare the Cheese Filling</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, and parsley. Mix well until smooth.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>3. Preheat the Oven</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>4. Assemble the Lasagna</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Lay 3–4 lasagna sheets over the sauce to cover the base.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture over the pasta sheets.</li>
            <li>Add 1/3 of the meat sauce on top, spreading evenly.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle 1/3 of the shredded mozzarella over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layering process two more times: pasta, ricotta, meat sauce, mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Finish with a final layer of lasagna sheets topped with remaining sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>5. Bake the Lasagna</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cover the dish with aluminium foil, ensuring it doesn't touch the cheese</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and bake for another 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>

    <h3>6. Rest and Serve</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before cutting into portions. This helps it set and makes serving easier.</li>
            <li>Garnish with fresh basil (optional) and serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!</p>
